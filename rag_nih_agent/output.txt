1 Introduction
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) em ploys advanced sequencing
t e c h n o l o g yt oi d e n t i f yt h en u c l e o t i d es e q u e n c eo fR N Am o l e c u l e sand measure the abundance of speci ﬁcR N At y p e sw i t h i nR N A
molecule populations ( Deshpande et al., 2023 ). Typically, the main
goal of RNA-Seq analysis is to detect g enes that are expressed differently
under various biological circumstances ( Piao and Ryu, 2017 ). Traditional
RNA-Seq analysis methodologies, whi le effective, often face limitations
in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are crucial forunderstanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases, includingcancer. This challenge is magni ﬁed by the complexity and sheer
volume of data genera ted, necessitating advanced analytical
approaches to fully harness the potential of RNA-Seq data.
Recent research has established that the application of machine
learning (ML) algorithms to RNA-Seq data can effectively classify
different problems based on gene expression pro ﬁles. Dag et al. ( Dag
et al., 2023 ) introduced GeneSelectML, an open-source web-based tool
for gene selection from RNA-Seq data using ML algorithms. It features6 ML algorithms, pre-processing steps, and graphical outputs likeheatmaps and network plots, alongside gene ontology analysis forDEGs. Demonstrated on Alzheimer ’s RNA-seq data, GeneSelectML
aids in identifying potential biomarkers by employing multiple ML
algorithms simultaneously for gene selection. This tool combines pre-
processing, visualization and ML methods. Stathopoulou et al.(Stathopoulou et al., 2024 ) investigated the overlap of ML
algorithms in RNA-seq analysis for estimating gene expressionacross various cancer types. Using Random Forest and GradientBoosting algorithms, their research demonstrated thereproducibility and overlap in identifying signi ﬁcant DEGs,
enhancing the understanding of genes ’roles in cancer development.
Their ﬁndings highlight the ef ﬁcacy of combining ML with RNA-seq
to improve the identi ﬁcation of critical DEGs, contributing valuable
insights into cancer biology and potentially improving diagnostic andtherapeutic strategies. Wang et al. ( Wang et al., 2018 )i d e n t i ﬁed
important features with three feature selection algorithms(Information Gain, Correlation Fe ature Selection, and ReliefF).
They employed ﬁve widely used classi ﬁers (Logistic Regression,
Classi ﬁcation via Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Model Trees,
Random Subspace) to predict DEGs. Their study demonstrates the
applicability of ML to improve the prediction and understanding ofgene expression, speci ﬁcally in relation to transcriptional regulation in
response to ethylene in plant seedlings. Piao and Ryu ( Piao and Ryu,
2017) introduced a novel approach for identifying DEGs in RNA-seq
data by applying a feature selection method that utilizes symmetricaluncertainty for gene ranking and a prede ﬁned relevance threshold for
selection. In their evaluation, the method achieved high sensitivity
(0.986) and speci ﬁcity (0.982) on large-sample datasets, outperforming
traditional statistical approaches like edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2009 ),
DESeq ( Love et al., 2014 ), and baySeq ( Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010 )i nterms of Area Under the Curve values, with notable improvements
observed even in challenging small-sample conditions. Arowolo et al.(Arowolo et al., 2020 ) developed a principal component analysis
(PCA) model to enhance RNA-seq malaria vector dataclassi ﬁcation using k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree
algorithms. The team aimed to address the challenge of highdimensionality in malaria vector RNA-seq data by employing PCA
for feature extraction. This method effectively reduced the dataset ’s
complexity, making it more manageable for classi
ﬁcation tasks. The
classi ﬁcation performance was evaluated on a mosquito Anopheles
gambiae RNA-Seq dataset, yielding accuracy rates of 86.7% for KNN
and 83.3% for Decision Tree classi ﬁers.
While the application of ML to RNA-Seq data shows promise, there
are concerns regarding the interpretability of the models. According toRudin ( Rudin, 2019 ), black box ML models may not be suitable for
high-stakes decisions in the context o f medical research. Instead, Rudin
suggests the use of interpretable models to ensure transparency andunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms ( Rudin, 2019 ). This
insight raises important consid erations for the development and
application of ML models in the context of RNA-Seq data analysis.The present study introduces a novel Machine Learning-EnhancedGenomic Analysis Pipeline (ML-GAP) utilizing autoencoders and dataaugmentation, aimed at addressing these challenges. By integrating ML
techniques with autoencoders and d ata augmentation strategies, ML-
GAP provides a new approach to enhance the detection of DEGs,particularly those elusive to conventional methods. Our pipeline notonly facilitates a more in-depth analysis of RNA-Seq data but also aidsin the identi ﬁcation of potential genes associ ated with clinical outcomes,
thereby offering new avenues for medical research. The incorporation ofexplainable arti ﬁcial intelligence (XAI) techniques distinguishes ML-
GAP, enabling a transparent and interpretable analysis that underscores
the signi ﬁcance of identi ﬁed genetic markers. ML-GAP stands as a
testament to the power of ML in genomic data analysis, setting a newstandard for accuracy, ef ﬁciency, and insights in the ﬁeld.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the materials and
methods used in the study are presented, covering thecomprehensive work ﬂow of ML-GAP for RNA-Seq data. In
Section 3 , we present the ﬁndings from applying the ML-GAP to
RNA-Seq data, highlighting the performance of our approach in
identifying DEGs and showcasing the effectiveness of the MixUp
method in improving model generalization. Additionally, the fullforms of the abbreviations are listed in Supplementary Table S1 .
2 Material and methods
2.1 Overview of the study
This study introduces ML-GAP, an approach speci ﬁcally designed
to address the challenges inherent in RNA-Seq data analysis. It
Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 02Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
leverages advanced ML techniques, including autoencoders and data
augmentation strategies such as MixUp, to enhance the detection ofDEGs. These methods not only improve the accuracy of geneexpression analysis but also offer robustness against the noise andvariability typical of RNA-Seq data. The pipeline is further re ﬁned by
the incorporation of XAI techniques, ensuring that the analytical
process remains transparent and the results interpretable. We
constructed this pipeline using Python as the main programminglanguage, integrating several libraries such as Scikit-learn for machinelearning, SHAP and LIME for explainability, and other tools forgenomic data preprocessing and analysis.
1. Count Data The initial step involves compiling a data matrix,
denoted as X, which has dimensions p-by-n, representing
genes -by-samples .
2. Data Preprocessing
a.Filtering: Applying both low count ﬁltering and zero-variance
ﬁlter to re ﬁne the count data.
b.Normalization : Employing DESeq median normalization to
adjust the data.
c.Transformation : Implementing variance stabilizing
transformation to make the data more suitable for analysis.
3. Dimension Reduction
a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is employed to
reduce the gene count in the genetic or molecular pro ﬁles
dataset to 2000. This step signi ﬁcantly simpli ﬁes the
complexity of the data, making it more manageable forsubsequent analysis and improving interpretability.
b. Dimension Reduction for Differentially Expressed Genes
(DEGs): Following PCA, the gene count is further reduced
to 200 features using differential expression analysis. This
focused reduction selects genes that show statisticallysigniﬁcant differences in expression associated with
clinical outcomes, thus enhancing the potential formeaningful biological insights and therapeutic targets.
4. Machine Learning Performance After applying the dimensionality
reduction techniques, we evaluated the performance of machinelearning models using three dist inct approaches: PCA and DEGs,
Autoencoders, and Augmentation with MixUp. For each
approach, we calculated several performance metrics, includingAccuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative PredictiveValue (NPV), Sensitivity, Speci ﬁcity, and F1 Score. These metrics
provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models ’effectiveness in
identifying DEGs across our datasets. We optimized the modelparameters using a 5-fold cross-va lidation grid search. To evaluate
the model performance, we used an independent test set, splitting
the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio using
the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.
a. PCA and DEGs Approach: Dimensionality was ﬁrst reduced
via PCA and DEGs selection. Machine learning models werethen applied to this re ﬁned dataset, and the performance was
assessed based on the aforementioned metrics.
b. Autoencoders Approach: Following dimensionality
reduction via autoencoders, models were trained and
evaluated similarly using the same set of metrics.
c. Augmentation Approach (MixUp ): The dataset was augmented
using the MixUp technique before applying the machine learningmodels, which were evaluated using the same metrics to assess
the impact of augmentation on model performance.
5. Explainable Machine Learning (XAI)
a.SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) SHAP is employed to
determine the in ﬂu e n c eo fe a c hg e n eo nt h em o d e l ’s output,
thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model ’s decisions.
It identi ﬁes the top-10 features based on the performance
evaluation.
b.LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LIME elucidates model predictions by approximating themodel locally with an interpretable surrogate, which helps inunderstanding the impact of various features on the model ’s
decisions. Top-10 features are identi ﬁed following the
analysis of model performance.
c.Variable Importance (VarImp) This technique highlights the
genes that signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence predictions, underlining
their biological importance. VarImp is used to determinetop-10 features after applying ML models and evaluatingtheir performance.
6. Biological Validation
a.Graphical Representations Visual representations are created
such as Volcano plots and Ven diagrams.
b.Gene Ontology The functionality of selected genes is compared
with existing literature to validate their roles and relevance inbiological processes and disease mechanisms.
2.2 Dataset and preprocesisng
We conducted an analysis utilizing two RNA-Seq datasets
pertaining to Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), sourced from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network.
2.2.1 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
From TCGA, we obtained sequencing reads for
20,531 recognized human RNAs from a cohort of 1,020 patientsdiagnosed with RCC. These patients were classi ﬁed into three
predominant subtypes: kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma
(KIRP), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and kidney
chromophobe carcinoma (KICH), with respective sample countsof 606, 323, and 91. In the RCC dataset, we excluded data labeled asKICH, maintaining only the records for KIRC and KIRP patients,culminating in a ﬁnal tally of 929 observations.
2.2.2 Lung cancer data
We utilized data on lung cancer obtained from the TCGA
platform. This dataset includes the mapped read counts for
20,531 recognized human RNAs from 1,128 patients with lungcancer. These patients were classi ﬁed into two speci ﬁc lung
cancer types: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamouscell carcinoma (LUSC), with respective sample sizes of 576 and 552.
Principal components plots for lung and RCC data, shown in
Figure 1 , illustrate the separation of samples based on the ﬁrst two
principal components. These plots highlight the inherent variance
within the datasets and the effectiv eness of the preprocessing steps.
The dimensionality reduction achieved through PCA is crucial forsubsequent analyses, as it highlig hts the distinct clustering of the
Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 03Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
different cancer subtypes, thereby con ﬁrming the integrity and
quality of our dataset.
2.2.3 Data preprocessing
RNA-Seq data inherently presents an abundance of zero values
and encompasses variations between samples stemming fromexperimental procedures. The preprocessing steps outlined in
Figure 2 are employed to mitigate the impact of low-quality
features and inter-sample variations. Initially, features withexceedingly low counts were excluded through near-zero varianceﬁltering ( Kuhn, 2008 ). Subsequently, a normalization process was
executed on the pre- ﬁltered raw counts before progressing to
downstream analyses. This step aimed to mitigate the in ﬂuence of
sequencing depth, technical variation, and potential biases, whileretaining the inherent biological variations among samples. To
achieve this, we implemented the median-ratio normalization
method from the DESeq2 package ( Love et al., 2014 ), chosen for
its resilience against outliers and its ef ﬁcacy in eliminating technical
variations across samples. We calculated the size factor s
jusing
DESeq normalization, as expressed by the following Equation 1 :sj/equalsmj

where Girepresents the geometric mean of raw counts for the i-th
feature. The quantity mjis computed over features having non-zero
geometric means. Various alternative normalization techniques, suchas the trimmed mean of M-values, upper quantile, Reads Per Kilobaseper Million mapped reads (RPKM), and the logarithm of counts per
million reads (log-CPM), are discussed in pertinent literature ( Bullard
et al., 2010 ;Mortazavi et al., 2008 ;Robinson and Oshlack, 2010 ). This
study employed the ‘variance stabilizing transformation (VST) ’
(Anders and Huber, 2010 ;Love et al., 2014 ), as implemented in
the DESeq2 package. The primary objective was to mitigate thedependence between mean and variance in normalized counts,thereby approximating the data to normality and rendering it lessskewed. It is imperative to acknowledge that following the VST
transformation, the variances exhibit approximate independence
from the mean. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that thesevariances remain unequal across all genes, potentially leading to thepresence of outliers within the dataset ( Zwiener et al., 2014 ).

Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 04Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
In the preprocessing step, we transfer the data from raw counts
to normalized counts. Given that RNA-Seq data contains manyfeatures and few observations (n≪p), it becomes imperative to
meticulously select a subset of features that exhibit associations withthe outcome and actively contribute to the ef ﬁcacy of the ﬁtted
model. Consequently, we are sequentially applying PCA and
differential expression analysis.
2.3 Dimension reduction
2.3.1 Principal component analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA ) is a statistical technique used
in data analysis and ML to emphasize variation and extract strong
patterns, with its modern version formalized by Hotelling ( Hotelling,
1933). It simpli ﬁes complex genetic information by transforming it into
a lower-dimensional space, reve aling key variables (principal
components). By highlighting signi ﬁcant relationships in high-
dimensional data, PCA aids in vis ualizing and analyzing genetic
patterns and biological processes. This study employs PCA afternormalizing RNA-Seq data to reduce its dimensionality.2.3.2 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
The identi ﬁcation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is
crucial in bioinformatics to detect genes with statisticallysigniﬁcant differences in expression levels across various sample
groups. After applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, furtheranalysis focuses on identifying DEGs to gain insights into genetic
expression changes linked to clinical outcomes. This dual approach
ensures that features selected for ML models are highly informative,both statistically and biologically, thereby reducing complexity whilehighlighting potential therapeutic targets.
2.4 Machine learning model performance
2.4.1 Autoencoders
Autoencoders, ﬁrst introduced by McClelland et al. (1987) , are a
type of neural network used in unsupervised learning, designed torecreate their input. Their primary function is to learn useful featuresor representations within the data. An autoencoder typically consistsof three key components: an encoder, a compressed representation(also known as the bottleneck or latent layer), and a decoder as seen in
FIGURE 2
Work ﬂow of the data processing and the pipeline in the proposed methodology. The work ﬂow utilized for processing and analyzing transcriptomics
data. Starting with raw count data, the process involves preprocessing steps such as ﬁltering and normalization, followed by dimension reduction through
principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis identi ﬁes differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which are then processed through ML techniques,
including PCA and DEGs and Autoencoders, to measure and enhance algorithm performance. The pipeline integrates data augmentationtechniques to improve model robustness and employs explainable arti ﬁcial intelligence (XAI) tools like SHAP to interpret the model outcomes. The
work ﬂow concludes with molecular biology validation to con ﬁrm the biological relevance of the ﬁndings.
Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 05Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
Figure 3 . The encoder condenses the data into a reduced-dimensional
space, and the decoder restores the data to its original shape. In our
study, we employed an autoencoder neural network structure toexplore dimensionality reduction within our dataset, which wassplit into training and test sets. The input layer of the autoencoderconsisted of 200 neurons, corresponding to the dimensionality of thedata in the training set. This was followed by an encoder layer with128 neurons and a hidden layer with 72 neurons, representing thecompressed representation of the input data. The decoder part of the
network then aimed to reconstruct the input data from this reduced
72-neuron representation. By training the autoencoder on the trainingset and evaluating its performance on the test set, we were able toassess the model ’s ability to reduce the dimensionality of the data from
200 to 72 while still retaining the essential characteristics necessary forreconstruction. The observations in the test set that resulted in thelowest reconstruction error, particularly the 72 with the most minimalerror, were identi ﬁed as those best represented by the autoencoder,
demonstrating the model ’s effectiveness in dimensionality reduction.
2.4.2 Augmentation (MixUp)
Zhang et al. ( Zhang et al., 2017 ) introduced an advanced data
augmentation technique, called MixUp, devised to address the issueof class imbalance by generating new samples through a strategiccombination of data points. This technique is grounded on theEquation 2 :
~x/equalsλx
i+1−λ () xj, ~y/equalsλyi+1−λ () yj, (2)
where ~xand ~ydenote the synthesized input and output pairs,
respectively. The coef ﬁcient λis sampled from the Beta distribution,
Beta(α,α), highlighting the signi ﬁcance of αas a crucial
hyperparameter in modulating the mixing intensity. The inputs xi
andxj, along with their corresponding outputs yiandyj, are selected
from distinct samples within the dataset. A distinctive aspect of ourimplementation of the MixUp algorithm is its application exclusively to
the minority class, aimed at im proving the representation of
underrepresented categories within the dataset without altering thedistribution of the majority class .T h i st a r g e t e da p p r o a c ht o w a r d st h e
minority class is designed to enhance the model ’s sensitivity to these
categories, potentially leading to i mproved fairness and accuracy in the
model ’s predictions across varied datasets.2.4.3 Machine learning model performance
In the analysis of RCC and lung cancer data, both Random Forest
and XGBoost ML algorithms were utilized to develop predictive models.To optimize the performance of these models, a comprehensive gridsearch was conducted to ﬁne-tune their hyperparameters. This involved
the use of repeated k-fold cross-validation, speci ﬁcally partitioning the
data into ﬁve folds, to ensure a robust evaluation of the model ’s
performance across various subsets of the data. The grid searchmethod, executed with a 5-fold cro ss-validation approach, is crucial
for verifying the generalizability and ef ﬁcacy of the ML models on
unseen data, thereby ensuring that the selected models are well-suitedfor predicting outcomes in RCC and lung cancer cases based on theirrespective optimized parameters. We explain different algorithm steps
in the following work ﬂow as represented in Figure 2 .
(a)PCA and DEGs : Initially, the dimensionality of the dataset was
reduced using PCA and the identi ﬁcation of DEGs. This step
was crucial for simplifying the dataset by focusing on the most
informative features.
(b)Autoencoders Approach : Following the initial dimensionality
reduction, autoencoders were utilized as an advanced techniqueto further compress the dataset into a more manageable size. Thiswas particularly bene ﬁcial for capturing complex, nonlinear
r e l a t i o n s h i p sw i t h i nt h ed a t a .M Lm o d e l sw e r et h e na p p l i e dt othis re ﬁned dataset, and their perform ance metrics were evaluated.
(c)Augmentation Approach : To augment the dataset post-initial
dimensionality reduction (PCA and DEGs), an augmentationtechnique, speci ﬁcally MixUp, was implemented. This approach
not only reduced dimensionality but also increased the number
of samples by blending observations. Subsequently, ML modelswere applied to this enhanced dataset, and their ef ﬁcacy was
assessed through various performance metrics.
2.5 Explainable Machine Learning (XAI)
Upon determining the most effective dimensionality reduction
method —be it PCA and DEGs, Autoencoders, or Augmentation
approaches, based on accuracy metrics —we proceeded to apply XAI
techniques to elucidate the predictive models further. Speci ﬁcally,
FIGURE 3
Detailed schematic of an autoencoder network for RNA sequencing data compression and reconstruction. The ‘Encoder ’stage (g(x)) processes the
input high-dimensional RNAseq data, compressing it into a condensed representation at the ‘Bottleneck Layer ’(z). Subsequently, the ‘Decoder ’stage (f(z))
aims to reconstruct the RNAseq data from this lower-dimensional representation to an output (x ’) that is as similar to the original input as possible. This
process enables the reduction of data complexity and noise, facilitating more ef ﬁcient storage and analysis.
Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 06Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
we utilized SHAP, LIME, and VarImp analyses and selected the top-
10 important features. These techniques were instrumental inidentifying the most signi ﬁcant features contributing to the
models ’predictions, thereby enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of our ML models. This step is critical forunderstanding the underlying mechanisms of the models ’
decisions, particularly in the complex domain of RCC and lung
cancer prediction, where interpretability is as crucial as accuracy.
2.6 Biological Validation
2.6.1 Graphical representations
Following the identi ﬁcation of effective features through the
application of XAI techniques, we visually represented these selectedfeatures using Volcano plots and Venn diagrams. Volcano plotswere employed to depict the statistical signi ﬁcance versus the
magnitude of change of the features, offering a clear visualizationof the most in ﬂuential features identi ﬁed by our models. Similarly,
Venn diagrams were utilized to illustrate the overlap and uniqueness
of signi ﬁcant features across different models or dimensionality
reduction techniques.
2.6.2 Gene ontology (GO)
In our analysis pipeline, we incorporated a Gene Ontology (GO)
step to ascertain whether the selected features are relevant to lung canceror RCC. This bioinformatics approach enables us to categorize theidenti ﬁed genes based on the related biological processes, cellular
components, and molecular functions. By mapping the signi ﬁcant
features to GO terms, we were ab le to validate the biological
signiﬁcance of these features in the context of lung cancer and RCC.
This step is crucial for ensuring that the ML models are not onlystatistically robust but also biologi cally relevant, thereby enhancing the
credibility and applicability of our ﬁndings in clinical settings. In this
step, we checked the selected feature s that are related to the literature on
lung cancer and listed the results listed in Table 2 .
3 Results and discussion
In our study, as delineated in Figure 2 , we initiated our data
preprocessing by applying a “Filtering ”step to the lung cancer and
RCC count data. This ﬁltering aimed at excluding features with low
variability, speci ﬁcally targeting those with negligible
variance —often referred to as ‘near-zero variance ’. This
preliminary re ﬁnement was critical to ensure the integrity of our
dataset, thereby preventing potential biases in the analysis due tosuper ﬂuous or non-informative data. Subsequent to the ﬁltering, we
proceeded with the normalization of the data in the “Normalization ”
step. For this purpose, we employed a median-ratio normalizationmethod, which is a part of the DESeq2 bioinformatics tool. This
particular normalization technique is known for its effectiveness in
reducing technical biases without distorting the genuine biological
differences between the samples. By employing this approach, wewere able to achieve a normalized dataset that reliably re ﬂects the
underlying biological conditions. In the subsequent phase of ouranalysis, following the ﬁltering and normalization steps, we
employed “PCA ”step as a dimensionality reduction technique.PCA is a robust statistical method that converts the data into a
series of linearly independent variables called principal components.This technique enables us to reduce the complexity of our data bytransitioning from a high-dimensional space —comprising
approximately 19,000 variables —to a more manageable, lower-
dimensional space. By doing so, PCA accentuates the most
signiﬁcant patterns and relationships within the data, which are
essential for our further analysis. The dimension reductionaccomplished through PCA is instrumental in enhancingcomputational ef ﬁciency and improving the interpretability of the
dataset, thus preparing the ground for the subsequent identi ﬁcation
of DEGs. Subsequent to dimensionality reduction through PCA,where we effectively condensed our dataset ’s features from around
2000 to 200 features, we embarked on the critical phase of
identifying DEGs in “DEGs ”step. DEGs are genes that show
statistically signi ﬁcant differences in expression levels between
different biological states or experimental conditions. In ouranalysis, the reduced dimensionality facilitated a more targetedand ef ﬁcient investigation into gene expression changes. By
applying statistical tests to the principal components, we wereable to detect genes whose expression levels were consistentlyaltered across our sample groups. This identi ﬁcation of DEGs is
a pivotal step in our research, as it lays the groundwork for
understanding the molecular mechanisms that may underlie thebiological phenomena under study. The DEGs serve as valuablemarkers for potential pathways that are activated or suppressed inresponse to speci ﬁc conditions, providing insights that are essential
for further biological interpretation and validation. After theﬁltering and dimension reduction steps, we compare the
proposed methods with classic PCA and DEGs dimension
reduction techniques in the Machine Learning Solution step. In
this step, we compare three different methods as seen below.
1. Machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost and Random
Forest, were applied to a dataset of 200 genes that had beenreﬁned through PCA and DEGs identi ﬁcation methods. The
effectiveness of these algorithms was evaluated using variousperformance metrics.
2. Autoencoders were then employed to further reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset, which resulted from PCA and
DEGs methods, down to 72 features. Subsequently, theXGBoost and Random Forest algorithms were applied tothis reduced dataset, and performance metrics werecalculated to assess the impact of thisdimensionality reduction.
3. The dataset of 200 genes, derived from PCA and DEGs
methods, was augmented using the MixUp technique, which
artiﬁcially expands the data pool without additional
dimensionality reduction. This augmentation is intended toenhance the robustness and generalizability of the ML models.After augmentation, the same ML algorithms were re-applied,and the resulting performance metrics were examined todetermine the effectiveness of this augmentation.
As detailed in Table 1 , the MixUp technique, when applied to the
RCC dataset, emerged as the most effective strategy across variousmetrics, particularly when used wi th the XGBoost model. This method
achieved outstanding performance, with perfect scores for NPV
Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 07Agraz et al. 10.3389/fgene.2024.1442759
(1.0000) and Recall (Sensitivity) ( 1.0000), indicating its accuracy in
correctly identifying both true negatives and true positives. Additionally,MixUp delivered impressive results in terms of Accuracy (0.9946),
Precision (PPV: 0.9915), and the F1 Score (0.9957), which highlights the
balance between Precision and Recall.
Although the computational time for MixUp was higher due to
the increased dataset size from synthetic data generation (asreﬂected in Table 1 ), the signi ﬁcant improvements in predictive
performance more than justify this added cost. Particularly in caseswhere achieving a balance between Precision and Recall is critical,MixUp proved to enhance model robustness and overall
classi ﬁcation performance. The technique ’s superior results in
handling imbalanced data, especially in the RCC dataset,underscore its potential to improve model reliability acrossvarious performance metrics.
Given the superior results yielded by the MixUp method, we
proceeded to identify the most impactful features affecting ourRNA-Seq data within this framework in “XAI ”step. Toaccomplish this, we calculated VarImp using the Random Forest
and XGBoost algorithms applied to both lung and RCC datasets. Wefurther enriched our analysis by implementing SHAP and LIME
methodologies to ascertain the top-10 most essential genes in our
model ’s performance. The selected genes were not only prominent
based on variable importance rankings but also stood out in SHAPand LIME analyses, con ﬁrming their signi ﬁcant role in the
predictive model. We have listed the top-10 features obtainedfrom the XGBoost and Random Forest models —namely SHAP,
LIME, and VarImp —inFigure 4 .
In the “Biological Validation ”, we utilize Volcano plots to
graphically illustrate the signi ﬁcant gene expressions identi ﬁed
during the XAI analysis. Figures 5 ,6in showcase these pivotal
ﬁndings for RCC and lung cancer data respectively. The plots
incorporate algorithms such as random forest and XGBoost inconjunction with interpretabil ity methods like LIME, SHAP, and

COL25A1, KCNAB1, PLXNB1, KDELC2, and APLN,identi ﬁed by VarImp, SHAP, and LIME.
As illustrated in Table 1 , given that both methods exhibited
performances that were roughly equivalent to each other, weinvestigated the ef ﬁcacy of the genes located at the intersection of
these two methods, as depicted in Figure 7 , by analyzing theireffectiveness in accordance with studies in the literature, as will
be seen in Table 2 .
InTable 2 , we present a summarized overview of gene regulation
patterns discernible in lung tissue and RCC, which are listed among
the intersected genes in Figure 7 . This table is pivotal for delineating
the differential expression of genes, as it systematically catalogs thosethat are upregulated and, notably, the singular gene that isdownregulated in the context of RCC. Our analysis employedtwo distinct methodologies, denoted as XGB and RF, to analyzegene expression patterns across lung and RCC tissues. The ‘Up/
Downregulated ’column indicates whether a gene is expressed at
higher (upregulated) or lower (downregulated) levels than a
predetermined baseline, which in this context is the normaltissue expression level. For lung tissue, the uniform upregulationacross both analytical methods (XGB and RF) highlights a consistentover-expression of genes like ATP1B3, which encodes the beta-3subunit of the Na
+/K+-ATPase, and CALML3, which is associated
with the calmodulin-like protein family. Similarly, keratin-associated genes KRT5 and KRT74 also exhibit upregulation,
suggesting a possible link to structural or regulatory changes in
lung tissue under pathological conditions. In contrast, the RCCtissue analysis reveals an intriguing pattern: while the majority ofgenes such as PLXNB1, associated with cellular structure andsignaling, are upregulated, TCF4 stands out as the sole gene thatis downregulated. TCF4, or Transcription Factor 4, is a pivotalelement of the Wnt signaling pathway, and its downregulation could

imply a signi ﬁcant deviation from normal cellular signaling and
transcriptional regulation in RCC.
Feature selection in RNA-Seq st udies is typically performed using
well-established modeling techniq ues available in R/BIOCONDUCTOR
packages like DESeq2 and edgeR. However, these methods are not
speciﬁcally designed to identify features that contribute most effectively
to classi ﬁcation models. Some features, despite being differentially
expressed between comparison groups, may not signi ﬁcantly improve
the predictive power of a ﬁtted model. To address this, we proposed a
hybrid feature selection methodology that aims to select features that areboth differentially expressed and contribute meaningfully to the
classiﬁcation model ’sp e r f o r m a n c e .
While our methodology is robust, its effectiveness may be
inﬂuenced by factors such as sample size, feature count, and
overdispersion in the data. A comprehensive simulation study,
particularly one focusing on Type-I and Type-II error rates,
would be valuable for further evaluating these factors. However,this falls beyond the current scope of our study and could beexplored in future research. The limitations mentioned have beenacknowledged within the manuscript.

4 Conclusion
This study introduced a ML-GAP that utilizes autoencoders and
data augmentation to enhance the detection and interpretation ofDEGs from RNA-Seq count data. The overarching goal was toaddress the limitations of traditional RNA-Seq analysis methods by
incorporating advanced ML techniques, thereby providing a deeper
understanding of gene expression patterns and their associationswith clinical outcomes. The ML-GAP work ﬂow includes several key
steps: data preprocessing to mitigate low-quality features and inter-sample variations; dimensionality reduction through PCA andDEGs identi ﬁcation; and data augmentation to increase the
robustness and generalizability of the ML models. Notably, theMixUp augmentation method demonstrated superior results,
especially in the context of RCC, indicating its effectiveness in
enhancing the predictive accuracy of our models. Therefore, wefurther analyzed the results obtained from the MixUp method in thenext step XAI. The application of XAI techniques, such as SHAP andLIME, has been crucial in ensuring the transparency andinterpretability of our ﬁndings. These methods allowed us to
identify the most impactful features, aligning with our objectiveto not only predict but also understand the biological signi ﬁcance
behind the predictions. The integration of GO analysis further
validated the relevance of these features in the context of lungcancer and RCC, underscoring the biological and clinicalimplications of our results.
The ML-GAP represents a signi ﬁcant advance in genomic
analysis, combining the strengths of ML, data augmentation, andinterpretability to uncover novel insights into gene expressiondynamics. However, challenges such as data quality,
computational demands, and the need for further methodological
reﬁnement remain. Future work will focus on addressing these
challenges, exploring additional datasets, and continuing toenhance the pipeline ’s accuracy and applicability to various
genomic contexts. Additionally, in future work, it will be valuableto explore the use of generative deep learning models for generatingrealistic bulk RNA-Seq gene expression data. Similar to Wang et al. ‘s
study ( Wang et al., 2024 ), which used Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to produce augmented datasets and analyzed
them with SHAP, integrating these models into our ML-GAPpipeline could signi ﬁcantly enhance data augmentation and
improve downstream analyses in high-throughput transcriptomics.
